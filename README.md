# ShellCode

What is ShellCode?

There are no any similarity between shellcode and shell scripting. Then why shellcode? Shellcode is an instance of a command line interpreter that use to exploit existing vulnerabilities in the target system or a program to get remote shell. Attackers could use that remote shell to access and more interaction with the victim's system (Target System). It is very simple. Using several lines of code we can gain the new remote shell from the victim's machine. Spawning new remote shell is a very lightweight process and very efficient.
